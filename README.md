# time_series_API_etl

A Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for time series data, designed to fetch data from APIs, process it, and store it efficiently for analytics and visualization. This project helps automate the retrieval and transformation of time series data, making it ready for downstream applications or databases.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Connects to various APIs to fetch time-series data.
- **ETL Workflow**: Modular stages for extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handles missing values, formats timestamps, and ensures data consistency.
- **Database Support**: Loads processed data into a database or storage system.
- **Configurable**: Easily adapt sources, transformations, and destinations via configuration files.
- **Logging & Error Handling**: Monitors ETL process and records errors for troubleshooting.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dibanga2800/time_series_API_etl.git
cd time_series_API_etl
```

Install dependencies (recommend using a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Configure API and ETL settings**:  
   Edit `config.yaml` or the relevant configuration file to specify API endpoints, authentication details, transformation rules, and loading destinations.

2. **Run the ETL pipeline**:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Monitor Logs**:  
   Review the logs in `logs/` directory for details on processed data and any errors encountered.

├── main.py              # Entry point for ETL execution
├── extract.py           # Handles data extraction from APIs
├── transform.py         # Cleans and transforms raw data
├── load.py              # Loads processed data into storage

```

## Configuration

- `config.yaml`: Define your API sources, transformation rules, and destination settings.
- Environment variables can be used for sensitive information (API keys, DB credentials).

## Example

```python
from extract import fetch_timeseries_data
from transform import clean_data
from load import save_to_db

# Extract
data = fetch_timeseries_data(api_config)

# Transform
cleaned = clean_data(data)

# Load
save_to_db(cleaned, db_config)
```
